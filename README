EasyCapture!

What is EasyCapture you ask? It's a simple image hosting/capturing 
script to make hosting/linking to images easier. If you post on forums, 
LiveJournal, or EBay the process for hosting an image can take a couple
of seconds. "A couple of seconds!?!" you say? That's too long for me, 
I'm lazy, what can I say. 

With EasyCapture all you have to do is navigate to a web page with 
an image on it you want to save. Click the bookmarklet I've provided 
for you and click the image and not only does EasyCreate host that 
image for you, it also creates a thumbnail for easy linking, and HTML 
you can use for that linking.

EasyCapture is released under the Gnu Public License. See the included
gpl.txt for more information.
