EasyCapture
===========

EasyCapture is a simple image hosting and capturing script.

Installation
------------

Uncompress the code to a path in your web root. Copy the `config.php.sample`
file to `config.php` after making any changes to fit your environment. That's
it. You're ready to host and capture images.

Point your browser to http://www.server.com/easy_capture/ to start using 
EasyCapture.

**Note:** The `images/` and `images/thumbs` directories need to be writable by your 
web server. If you forget EasyCapture will warn you the directory permissions
are not correct.
